# Cannonball 2023

After using a Garmin training plann to perpare for the event, I was looking forward to a great ride. The ride was great, but it was a mixed bag and the effectiveness of the training is in question.

Some notes on the results: The top entry was the Tour of Richmond almost ten years ago.  In the ride I was with a fast group for about 65 miles at about 21 mph. The final 35 was at about 16.6 mph. This ride, 2023, was ranked at 5 of 13. 

I was able to break this ride into eight stages based on significant circumstances.
